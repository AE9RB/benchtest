# benchtest Documentation

The benchtest library is a benchmark and testing framework for C++.

## Installation

 1. Download or clone from GitHub. <https://github.com/AE9RB/benchtest>
 2. Add the \c include directory to your compiler include path.
 3. \#include <benchtest.hpp>
 
The benchtest library is a collection of headers like the Standard Template
Library. There's nothing to compile except your own application.
There are no dependencies to install. The only thing you need to bring
to the party is a C++11 or newer compiler.
